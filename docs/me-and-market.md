# My role and skills

## My role
**DevOps Engineer**

I chose this role because:
1. I’m fascinated by automation, infrastructure, and how software scales in production.
2. I enjoy scripting and solving operational puzzles more than building UIs.
3. DevOps skills are highly transferable across industries and cloud platforms.

## Skills I already have
- **Linux CLI** – Intermediate: comfortable with file systems, permissions, process management.
- **Bash scripting** – Beginner: wrote simple automation scripts for lab tasks.
- **Git** – Intermediate: used in all coursework and personal projects.
- **Docker** – Beginner: containerized a Python web app once for a class demo.
- **Basic networking** – Beginner: understand HTTP, DNS, ports, and firewalls at a conceptual level.

## Skills I clearly lack
- **Kubernetes** – Industry standard for container orchestration; essential for any cloud-native role.
- **CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)** – Needed to automate testing and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** – Allows reproducible, version-controlled cloud setups.
- **Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)** – Critical for observability in production systems.
- **Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP)** – Most jobs require hands-on experience with at least one major provider.

Most challenging: **Kubernetes** — complex architecture with many abstractions (pods, services, ingress, etc.).

## Skills that appear in several postings
1. **Linux** – 7/7 postings  
2. **Docker** – 6/7 postings  
3. **Git** – 5/7 postings  
4. **Cloud (AWS/GCP)** – 4/7 postings  
5. **CI/CD** – 4/7 postings  

## Skills specific to a single posting
- **NixOS** – only at JetBrains (functional package management, niche but powerful)
- **OpenStack/Ceph** – only at DataLine (on-prem cloud stack, less common in startups)
- **Ansible** – only at Tinkoff (alternative to Terraform for config management)

These reflect company-specific tech stacks or legacy infrastructure choices.

## My skills and market demands
My foundation in Linux and Docker is a good start, but almost every real job expects Kubernetes and cloud experience — which I don’t have. I also underestimated how much scripting (Python/Bash) and monitoring matter. While I’m not ready for mid-level roles, I see a clear path: master Docker deeply, then learn AWS basics and a CI tool. The gap is wide but structured.

## Skills that I can improve
1. **Docker (advanced usage)** – Learn multi-stage builds, volumes, networking, and compose.
2. **GitHub Actions** – Automate deployment of a sample app to showcase CI/CD understanding.

I’ll use the official Docker docs, AWS Educate, and deploy a dummy service on EC2 to practice. This is achievable within a semester alongside other courses.
